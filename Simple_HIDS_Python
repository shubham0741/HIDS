HIDS Super awesome project 

attacker.py # Create file to connect to port and send connection. Change $Port$ on which attacking
import socket as s

c=s.socket()
c.connect(("Localhost",$PORT$))


Make different Server files and run. This will create a server on the port and listed for malicious connections. 
server.py # Enter the port on which you want to create server and then atack it for proof of concept from attacker.py file. 
import socket as s

port=int(input("Enter Port to scan on"))
c=s.socket(s.AF_INET,s.SOCK_STREAM)
print("Socket created successfully")
c.bind((s.gethostbyname("Localhost"),port))
c.listen(1)
print("Waiting for connection on ", port )
while True:
    s,a=c.accept()
    print("Malicious connected on port with  ip and port",a)
    s.close()
c.close()
